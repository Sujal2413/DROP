    title: 'Why Aluminium Cans Are the Ultimate Alternative to Plastic Bottles',
    metaDescription: 'Explore why infinitely recyclable aluminium is replacing single-use plastic, keeping water colder and protecting oceans from microplastics.',

        <p>
          Every year, millions of tons of plastic water bottles end up in landfills, rivers, and oceans. Despite global recycling efforts, only a small fraction of plastic is recycled, and the rest degrades over centuries into harmful microplastics.
        </p>
        <p>
          At DROP., we believe that the solution isn&apos;t just better recycling habits; it&apos;s changing the vessel itself. That&apos;s why we package our premium still and functional water in 100% recyclable aluminium cans. Here&apos;s why aluminium is the sustainable alternative we need.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white uppercase mt-10 mb-4" style={{ fontFamily: '"Anton", sans-serif' }}>
          1. Infinitely Recyclable
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unlike plastic, which downgrades in quality each time it is recycled (and can typically only be recycled once or twice before becoming unusable waste), aluminium is infinitely recyclable. It does not lose its structural integrity during the recycling process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that a DROP. can today can be melted down and turned into a brand-new aluminium can within 60 days, repeatedly, forever. In fact, nearly 75% of all aluminium ever produced is still in active use today!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white uppercase mt-10 mb-4" style={{ fontFamily: '"Anton", sans-serif' }}>
          2. No Microplastics in Your Water
        </h2>
        <p>
          Recent scientific studies have revealed that bottled water contains hundreds of thousands of microscopic plastic particles (nanoplastics) per liter. When plastic bottles are exposed to heat, transport friction, or simple storage time, they shed particles directly into the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          By choosing aluminium, you eliminate the risk of consuming microplastics, ensuring that your hydration is as pure and clean as nature intended.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white uppercase mt-10 mb-4" style={{ fontFamily: '"Anton", sans-serif' }}>
          3. Stays Colder, Longer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Beyond environmental benefits, aluminium possesses high thermal conductivity. It chills rapidly and retains cold temperatures much more effectively than PET plastic or glass, giving you a crisp, refreshing, ice-cold drink every time.

          Our bodies are composed of roughly 60% water. While standard hydration keeps us alive, functional water is designed to help us thrive. In recent years, functional beverages have taken the health and fitness world by storm. But what exactly is functional water, and how does it work?
        </p>
        <p>
          Functional water is pure water that has been enhanced with health-promoting ingredients, such as natural herbal extracts, vitamins, trace minerals, or active electrolytes.
        </p>

          Electrolytes and Performance
        </h2>
        <p>
          For athletes and fitness enthusiasts, standard water is sometimes not enough to replenish what is lost during sweat. Active exercise expels critical salts like sodium, potassium, and magnesium. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our DROP. Athlete Edition functional water is packed with trace minerals and higher electrolyte concentrations to accelerate muscle recovery, prevent cramping, and optimize cellular hydration.
        </p>

          Botanical Infusions
        </h2>
        <p>
          Functional water can also harness the power of plants. By infusing water with natural extracts like mint or clove, we unlock digestive and cooling benefits.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Mint Infusion:</strong> Sourced to provide crisp sensory cooling, aid digestion, and boost alertness.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          By keeping functional water free from added sugars, artificial sweeteners, and coloring, DROP. provides a clean, premium alternative to sugary sports drinks.

          For centuries, traditional wellness systems across Asia have used cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) as a natural remedy. From digestion to oral care, cloves are rich in eugenol, a compound known for its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          At DROP., we have modernised this ancient secret by creating DROP Clove Water—a premium, sugar-free functional water infused with organic clove extracts, served cold in infinitely recyclable aluminium cans.

          Digestive & Vitality Support
        </h2>
        <p>
          Drinking clove water after meals is a popular traditional practice in India. Clove extract stimulates digestive enzymes, reduces bloating, and supports gut comfort.

        <p>
          Cloves rank exceptionally high on the ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) scale, meaning they are incredibly effective at neutralizing free radicals and supporting cellular wellness. Our clove water delivers these benefits in a clean, refreshing daily format.
